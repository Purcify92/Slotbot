# Slotbot
 A discord economy bot built using MongoDB
## Important
 Make a .env file that includes your discord bot token and MongoDB connection URI
 
 The file should look something like this:
 ```
 TOKEN=<DISCORD BOT TOKEN HERE>
 URI=<MONGODB CONNECTION URI HERE>
 ```

 If you have any issues with the bot feel free to open an Issue and I should be there to help shortly.
